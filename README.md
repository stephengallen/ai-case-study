# AI Case Study
## _Overview and Origin_
* Suno AI - Music creation software
* The company was incorporated in 2023.
* The founders are lifelong musicians and aspiring technologists Mikey Shulman, Georg Kucsko, Martin Camacho, and Keenan Freyberg.
* Suno AI is investor-funded, including a $125 million dollar funding round backed by Lightspeed Venture Partners as of May 2024.

## _Business Activities_
* The company is leading the charge towards a future that enables anyone to create and share music, with or without previous experience or background.
* The company's intended customer is mostly for everyday people, as they have over 10 million users already, however their program is also used by Grammy Award winners and professional musisicians. 
* From [dataconomy.com] (https://dataconomy.com/2024/04/25/how-to-use-suno-ai-music-generator/#:~:text=Suno%20AI%20employs%20deep%20learning,%2C%20rhythm%2C%20and%20even%20lyrics).
* > Suno AI employs deep learning algorithms trained on a massive dataset of music. By analyzing this data, the AI learns the intricacies of music composition, including melody, harmony, rhythm, and even lyrics. When a user provides a text prompt, Suno leverages this knowledge to generate a complete song that reflects the user’s description.

## _Landscape_
* The company is in the field of Arts and Entertainment
* The major trends and innovations in this field over the last 10 years have been numerous from AI generated art (MidJourney), video creation (Sora, ElevenLabs) and music (Suno, Udio).
* The other major companies in the music-generation portion of the field are Udio, Loudly, Junia and Soundful. The major players in the text to music generation software are Suno and Udio, which is currently in Beta. These two companies will be at the forefront of AI music generation for years to come.

## _Results_
> Suno has accomplished a lot in a very short amount of time. Since their product went live only a few months ago, more than 10 million people have been able to express their creativity by making  music on Suno. One of the world’s biggest companies, Microsoft, has integrated Suno directly in their AI-powered Copilot software. And Suno’s latest AI model, version 3, can generate full length songs worthy of top 40 radio airplay in mere seconds.
* Some of the core metrics the company uses are registered-users and Suno AI currently has over 10 million users and counting.
* Suno AI seems to be at the fore-front of text based music generation software and is leading all competitors in monthly users. It should be noted, that it has also been out longer than its direct competitor Udio, which is currently still in beta. 

## _Recommendations_
* In terms of services Suno AI could offer in the future, they should look at what their direct competitor Udio is doing. Udio offers a variety of ways to customize and manipulate your generated songs, features that Suno currently doesn't implement or offer.
* If they were to provide more of this customization and editing of generated songs, Suno would benefit greatly from a quickly evolving race where people are looking to make something quickly and professionally, while also hoping to something completely unique and customized.
